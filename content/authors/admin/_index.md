    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My name is **Xu Ruolun**, and I am currently a junior student at the College of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering at Shenzhen University. My research interests focus on the field of optical measurement, particularly in the application and development of event camera technology. In this area, I am actively participating in related research projects, exploring high-precision imaging techniques of event cameras in dynamic scenes.
In terms of technical skills, I have solid experience in embedded development and am familiar with various development platforms and programming languages, enabling me to effectively carry out the collaborative design of hardware and software. Additionally, I have a deep understanding of hardware system design and implementation, allowing me to independently complete all stages from conceptual design to prototype production.
I am passionate about applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems and hope to promote innovation and development in optical measurement technology through further research and practice. At the same time, I aspire to engage in in-depth academic exchanges with peers and experts to broaden my horizons and enhance my professional competence.
